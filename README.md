# Deep Cross-Modal Face Naming for News

This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Cross-Modal Face Naming for News project. The goal of this project is to associate facial images with names mentioned in news articles using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

The Deep Cross-Modal Face Naming model analyzes multimodal data (images and text) from news content to link facial images with corresponding names. This has applications in areas like automated journalism, facial recognition, and content retrieval.

## Features:

**Face Detection:** Detects faces in images using pre-trained models like Haar cascades.<br>
**Text Processing:** Processes and analyzes names mentioned in news articles.<br>
**Cross-Modal Mapping:** Links facial images with corresponding names using deep learning techniques.<br>

**Python version:** 3.7.0

## Usage
**To run the project, execute the following command:**
python Deepmodal.py
